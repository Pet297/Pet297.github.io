<h2>INFORMATION</h2>
<p>Currently accepting only B-day requests.</p>
<p>Requests in <span style="color:#80FF80;">GREEN</span> are finished, but not uploaded. You can ask to have them uploaded right away!</p>
<p>Requests in <span style="color:#8080FF;">BLUE</span> are to be done in near time. This is more of a note to myself.</p>
<p>Requests in <span style="color:#FF8080;">RED</span> have problems preventing them from being fully finished, most likely a missing remix. I'll add the descriptions of the problems later. For now, it's more like a personal note for myself for sake of finishing the existing requests.</p>

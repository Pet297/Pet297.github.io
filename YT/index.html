<h2>INFORMATION</h2>
<p>On YouTube, I'm currently focused on making Sparta Remix related stuff.
There is also also a game making channel that will be expanded more in 2025.</p>
<p>One important thing is that I do a lot of requests.
Requests are closed most of the time, because I'm busy.
Still, there is chance you will get some.
Especially, with more dedicate software I make, I expect my productivity go up in terms of requests.</p>

<h2>REQUEST LISTS</h2>
<p>Below are request lists for various things I do.</p>

<h2>STUFF TO TRY</h2>
<p>Coming soon: Sparta Remix Challenge generator - it will pseudo-randomly pick few general ideas from a list and your challenge will be to make a remix using this list of ideas. It will refresh every hour with a new list.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use 3 minute long base + Have a pitch sample that plays different pattern on each chorus + Try to make it within 3 hours</li>
<li>Use an obscure cartoon source + Make it more complex than you would usualy do + Mix at least 2 sparta bases for the remix</li>
</ul>

<h3>Note</h3>
<p>
I may add some links myself.
</p>
<p>
Do you have your own website and are a remixer?
Feel free to let me know and I will link you here.
I want more personal internet back, not the centralised shit we have now.
Making your own website and linking to people with shared interests is how we get old internet back.
On this subsite, I link specifically to other Sparta Remixers.
Check other subsites for more interests and people!
